# Microsoft Paint 2.0 Using Java
The best way to learn OOP in Java is to implement a project by yourself, using object concepts. This repository is based on implementing the Microsoft Paint Application - using Java. 



Created a Paint 2.0 as project for the course Object Oriented Programming. The program implements the basic features of Paint, allowing the user to draw, fill colour, erase shapes, draw using a pen and mix and match colours. Along with this, it uses layers, allowing the user to switch between different layers. The Graphical User Interface for this project has been implemented through J Panel.
